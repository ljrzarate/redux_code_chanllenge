# README

This repo is for a code challange:

Link: https://redux-code-challenge.herokuapp.com/

Once you are in the link above you will be able to create a user in the app.
The *username* will be the email you have, removing the "@gmail" part.
(e.g for the email: ljrzarate@gmail.com the username will be ljrzarate)

Once you log in, you will be able to add post and tag other users in the app.

I added a table with the current users so it will be easy to see the users.

You can tag other users while creating a Post or a Comment by adding an "@"
before the username (e.g @ljrzarate)

To add a avatar you have to click in the user icon in the nav bar and click on
profile, there you you see the field to add an avatar.

Users that have avatar attached to it, once they make a comment you can see it
next to the username in every comment they make.

You can use:
email: ljrzarate@gmail.com
password: Password!

For the first login or go ahead and create you own account.
